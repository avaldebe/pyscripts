# Dave's python scripts

Scripts are mainly designed to work with EMEP files, especially the netcdf outputs, but will also accept other formats sometimes (e.g. EHCAM).

* Mainly python3
* Tested in modern (2016-2017) Xubuntu systems, 
* Mapping uses cartopy (which is not always in Ububtu repos, but available from github, or via conda, etc.)

Some comments
==============

I'm still a beginner with python. All scripts can be done better!
